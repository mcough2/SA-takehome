# Technical Takehome Exercise

## Part 1: Query Metronome API to produce customer summary report

### Overview
This technical takehome exercise involves querying the Metronome API to generate a customer summary report. The report will provide a comprehensive overview of customer data extracted from the Metronome platform.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this exercise are as follows:
- Query the Metronome API to retrieve relevant customer data.
- Process the retrieved data to generate a summary report.
- Include essential customer information such as demographics, transaction history, and any other pertinent details.
- Ensure the generated report is clear, concise, and provides actionable insights.

### Instructions
Follow these steps to complete Part 1 of the exercise:
1. Obtain access credentials or API keys required to authenticate with the Metronome API.
2. Develop a script or program capable of making HTTP requests to the Metronome API.
3. Define the necessary API endpoints and parameters to retrieve customer data.
4. Extract and process the retrieved data to generate the customer summary report.
5. Ensure proper error handling and data validation throughout the process.
6. Document any assumptions made or limitations encountered during the development process.

### Deliverables
